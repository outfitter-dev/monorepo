# Linear Workflow

- Track all work under the **Monorepo** team in Linear.
- Branch names and commits should reference the Linear issue ID (`MONO-<number>`).
- Status flow: `Todo` → `In Progress` → `In Review` → `Ready to Merge` → `Done`.
- When opening a PR/stack, link the Linear issue and update status to `In Review`.
- Close issues only after the stack lands on `main` and tests pass.
