# Continuous Integration (Placeholder)

Full CI is not configured yet. Until we wire up GitHub Actions:

- Treat `bun run format`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run test` as mandatory gates.
- Document additional checks (e.g., package-specific tests) in PR descriptions.
- When CI gets added, update this file with the workflow name, required jobs, and badge links.
