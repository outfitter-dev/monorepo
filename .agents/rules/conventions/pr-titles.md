# PR Title Convention

- Format: `<scope>: <summary>`
  - `scope` aligns with package/app name or concern (`core`, `cli`, `docs`, `infra`).
  - `summary` is imperative (`add workspace scaffold`, `update ultracite config`).
- Include the Linear ID in the PR body, not the title.
- For stacked PRs (Graphite), scopes can repeatâ€”Graphite handles suffixes automatically.
