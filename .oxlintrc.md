# Oxlint Configuration Rationale

## Disabled Rules

### `sort-imports`
**Rationale**: Import organization is handled by Ultracite through Biome. Having both tools manage imports would create conflicts and inconsistent formatting.

### `unicorn/no-null`
**Rationale**: The codebase intentionally uses `null` where appropriate for external API compatibility and to distinguish between "not set" (null) vs "set to empty" (undefined) semantics.

### `unicorn/require-module-specifiers`
**Rationale**: Module specifier requirements are handled by TypeScript's module resolution configuration.
